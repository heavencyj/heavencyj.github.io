Fobs like to use weird words that have meanings rather than real English names.
I am no exception. <strong>Heaven </strong>has great meanings and it actually sounds like a name.
After the confusion phase, people tend to find it hard to forget.</p><p>I have a few hobbies. In winter, I am probably on the slopes in one of the resorts in 
Lake Tahoe for most weekends. In summer, chances are I am living in a big tent with my friends
somewhere in the woods. Outdoor stuffs are fun. After work, sometimes I shoot hoops with
coworkers, sometimes I hit golf balls and sometimes I play random card games with friends. 
San Francisco is a cool place with so many options and I am very glad I live here.</p><p>CS Bachelor and Master degree from Rice University in 2013. Software Engineer at

During my last semester in college, I made a fun iPhone game with two friends. It is kinda like the 
popular running game Temple Run, but with cuter characters. 
Thanks to the awesome artwork from <a href="http://linhtrando.com/">Linh Tran Do</a>, we have different maps
featuring jungle, mountain, dessert and various characters including a monkey,
a pig, a bear. Game play is simple: turn left/right and jump to avoid hitting 
walls or obstacles; collect items to get bonus points and unlock new maps;
the goal is to get as many points as possible before you hit something and die.</p><p>We didn't have the chance to put it in app store but here is the trailer.

Oct 2010 - Dec 2010</h4><p>During Grace Hopper Celebration in 2010, I learned about Microsoft Imagine Cup,
a global student technology competition. The theme that year was to solve the world's
tough problem. Me and two partners chose to focus on the lack female in the technology field.
Back then the topic wasn't as hot as now and there weren't many good ways to connect
women in the technology field. We decided to start with college students and build an
windows phone app(it's a Microsoft sponsored competition) that connects female engineering 
students to mentors and other peers. </p><p>Here is our competition video entry. We didn't go very far, but definitely a very
good learning experience. It was my first time working sorta like a project manager as 
well as the main developer.<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cv-z6m29sgM" class="embed-responsive-item"></iframe></div></p></div></div></div></body></html>
