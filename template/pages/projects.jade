    h4 Plushy Pals - iPhone game. Jan 2013 to May 2013.
    p 
        | During my last semester in college, I made a fun iPhone game with two friends. It is kinda like the 
        | popular running game Temple Run, but with cuter characters. 
        | Thanks to the awesome artwork from 
        a(href='http://linhtrando.com/') Linh Tran Do
        | , we have different maps
        | featuring jungle, mountain, dessert and various characters including a monkey,
        | a pig, a bear. Game play is simple: turn left/right and jump to avoid hitting 
        | walls or obstacles; collect items to get bonus points and unlock new maps;
        | the goal is to get as many points as possible before you hit something and die.

        | We didn't have the chance to put it in app store but here is the trailer. 
        | You can also see the source code in my 
        a(href='https://github.com/heavencyj') github.

    h4  Inspira - Microsoft Imagine Cup 2011 Entry. Oct 2010 - Dec 2010
    p
        | During Grace Hopper Celebration in 2010, I learned about Microsoft Imagine Cup,
        | a global student technology competition. The theme that year was to solve the world's
        | tough problem. Me and two partners chose to focus on the lack female in the technology field.
        | Back then the topic wasn't as hot as now and there weren't many good ways to connect
        | women in the technology field. We decided to start with college students and build an
        | windows phone app(it's a Microsoft sponsored competition) that connects female engineering 
        | students to mentors and other peers. 
    p
        | Here is our competition video entry. We didn't go very far, but definitely a very
        | good learning experience. It was my first time working sorta like a project manager as 
        | well as the main developer.
