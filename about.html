<h3>about</h3><p>Why is my name <strong>Heaven</strong>? It's not from my mom or dad. They don't know much English.
Fobs like to use weird words that have meanings rather than real English names.
I am no exception. <strong>Heaven </strong>has great meanings and it actually sounds like a name.
After the confusion phase, people tend to find it hard to forget.</p><p>I have a few hobbies. In winter, I am probably on the slopes in one of the resorts in 
Lake Tahoe for most weekends. In summer, chances are I am living in a big tent with my friends
somewhere in the woods. Outdoor stuffs are fun. After work, sometimes I shoot hoops with
coworkers, sometimes I hit golf balls and sometimes I play random card games with friends. 
San Francisco is a cool place with so many options and I am very glad I live here.</p><p>CS Bachelor and Master degree from Rice University in 2013. Software Engineer at
